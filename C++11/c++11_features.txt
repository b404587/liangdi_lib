1、long long , at least 64bits,at least as large as long

2、list initialization,
	int i= {0}; int i{0};int i(0); int i = 0;
	vector<T> v1{a, b, c};   vector<T> v2= {a, b, c};

3、nullptr, the same as 0 or NULL

4、constexpr it's a good idea to use constexpr for variables that you intend to use as constant expressions.
	constexpr int *p = nullptr; //p is a const pointer to int
	
5、types alias typedef double wages;  using wages = double;

6、auto , type deducing

7、decltype , if p is a pointer to int , decltype(*p) is int&, not plain int

8, in-class initializer

..
9、vector<int> v; auto iter3 = v.cbegin(); iter3 has type vector<int>::const_iterator;
